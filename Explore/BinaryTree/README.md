# Binary Tree

[https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/)

## Introduction

A `tree` is a frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.

Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes. From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph which has `N nodes` and `N-1 edges`.

A `Binary Tree` is one of the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has `at most two children`, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

By completing this card, you will be able to:

1. Understand the concept of a `tree` and a `binary tree`;
2. Be familiar with different `traversal` methods;
3. Use `recursion` to solve binary-tree-related problems;
